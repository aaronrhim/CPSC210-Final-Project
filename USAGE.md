# Usage documentation

Running the application in general is as simple as:
```bash
    java -cp bin ui.Main
```
Notes: 
- If you want to run the GUI version, simply add the argument "viewer"
- If you are running into problems, you may have to downgrade your Java runtime to jdk8 because when I compiled main, I compiled on jdk8
