# Deep Learning - Custom CNN model architecture + (if time) application

## Project Description  

**What will the application do?**
This application will be able to classify images (uploaded to a local database by the user).

**Who will use it?**
- Mainly recruiters who are looking at my resume/project portfolio
- I will use it if I want to refer back to the math in CNN architecture
- Students interested in learning more about the math in CNN architecture might use it

**Why is this project of interest to you?**  
I am interested because it combines my interests in Java programming and artificial intelligence. By implementing the mathematical operations manually (convolution, activation, forward/backward passes), I will deepen my understanding of how models work internally, while also creating a desktop application that can classify images. Whats most concerning for me though is that this might be a waste of time. Since I'm applying to software development roles, spending too much time on this project will not improve my skill in software development. 

**Key elements of the project include:**  
- Functions for each feature (Conv, Activation frames, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics)
- A thread to add epoch progress to a db (satisfying the saving requirement)
- Possibly a GUI button that allows a user to upload a picture (which will then be saved into another db)
- Documentation

## User Stories  

- As a user, I want to see how convolution works mathematically with good documentation
- As a user, I want to see how an activation frame works mathematically with good documentation
- As a user, I want to see whether or not the model guesses my uploaded image correctly
- As a user, I want to clone the repo myself and resume training progress from whether it last left off
- As a user, I want to see a graph on whether or not the accuracy for predicting images is increasing or not
