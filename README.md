# Deep Learning - Custom CNN model functions + application (gui/graphs/button)

## Project Description  

**What will the application do?**
This application will allow users to input a k-D function and visualize gradient descent in a k-D space. They will also be able to modify the learning rate and a few other parameters. 

**Who will use it?**
- Mainly recruiters who are looking at my resume/project portfolio
- I will use it if I want to visualize some form of polymorphic prediction
- Students interested in learning more about the math in CNN architecture might use it

**Why is this project of interest to you?**  
I am interested because it combines my interests in Java programming and artificial intelligence. While previously I wanted to make a larger pipeline (CNN model), I realize that it was a little too ambitious and that I would rather focus on a specific sub-sector such as gradient descent and optimization as well as the visualization aspect. 

**Key elements of the project include:**  
- Functions for each feature (Conv, Activation frames, hyperparameters, evaluation metrics)
- A thread to add epoch progress to a db (satisfying the saving requirement)
- Possibly a GUI button that allows a user to upload a picture (which will then be saved into another db)
- Documentation

## User Stories  

- As a user, I want to see how convolution works mathematically with good documentation
- As a user, I want to see how an activation frame works mathematically with good documentation
- As a user, I want to see whether or not the model guesses my uploaded image correctly
- As a user, I want to clone the repo myself and resume training progress from whether it last left off
- As a user, I want to see a graph on whether or not the accuracy for predicting images is increasing or not
- As a user, I want to see the effect of convolution on an image that I provide the program with (GUI)
- As a user, I want to be able to input my own paths to my images for the convolution functions to apply their math to
- As a user, I want to be able to learn more about the project just by looking through the code and seeing good documentation
